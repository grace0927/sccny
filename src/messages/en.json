  "ConfessionOfFaith": {
    "title": "Confession of Faith",
    "introduction": "Our belief is based on the following 9 points:",
    "point1": "We believe that only the Bible is divinely inspired, completely trustworthy in its entirety without error, consisting of sixty-six books in the Old and New Testaments. The Bible which reveals the creation and the redemption of our Lord, is the only complete rule of faith, worship, and conduct for us (2 Timothy, 3:16-17).",
    "point2": "We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:16-17,28:19, 1 Peter 1:2, 2 Corinthians 13:14).",
    "point3": "We believe God is Spirit. He is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent and who was, who is and who is to come. We believe in God, creator of the universe, perfect in holiness, infinite in wisdom, full of righteousness and mercy and love. We believe His sovereignty in creation and providence and manipulation of the whole universe (Genesis 1:1, Exodus 3:14, John 4:24, Romans 11:33-36, Revelation 4:8).",
    "point4": "We believe in Jesus Christ His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and buried for our sin; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; after forty days He ascended into heaven and sat on the right hand of God Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead (Matthew 1:18-25, 26:53-54, John 1:1-14, 3:16, Romans 1:3-4, 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, Ephesians 1:20-23, 2 Corinthians 5:20-21, Hebrews 4:14, 1 Timothy 4:1, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 20:11-15).",
    "point5": "We believe in the Holy Spirit, who came from God to reprove the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgement, to regenerate, to sanctify and to comfort by residing in them, those who believe in Jesus Christ (John 16:7-14, Romans 14:17, 1 Peter 1:2, Galatians 5:16-18,22).",
    "point6": "We believe that man was created in the image and the likeness of God, but in Adam and Eve all men have fallen into sin and sinners men cannot save themselves, but through Jesus Christ who died on the cross that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:3, 3:16, 5:24, 14:6, Romans 3:23, 5:12, 5:17-18, Ephesians 4:24, Genesis 1:26).",
    "point7": "We believe that the church is an assembly of believers whom God has chosen among men. We believe that Christ is the head of the church. Church is the body of the Christ, and that under His spiritual control the different parts work together. When each separate part works as it should, the whole body grows and builds itself up through love for the purpose of revealing Christ to the world and bringing the unsaved unto Christ, our Lord (1 Corinthians 1:1-2,12:12-13, Ephesians 4:15-16, 5:23).",
    "point8": "We believe that anyone who has accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Savior, and believed in the power of the redemption and reborn by the blood of Christ on the cross, should obey His commandment through baptism and communion in memory of our Lord until His Second Advent (Romans 6:3-6 Matthew 26:26-30, 1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 11:23-33).",
    "point9": "We believe that upon His Second Advent the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we who are alive shall be brought up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Our Lord with believers shall reign on earth for one thousand years. Then comes the new heaven and new earth; Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords and believers shall live with Him forever and ever (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Jude 14, Revelation 20-22)."

The Lord Jesus is our example for us to follow. Throughout history, He has attracted countless people to come to Him, to His presence, to seek His face, to ask for His salvation.",
    "description": "The church is the home of eternal life. Because of the Lord's love, many souls seek truth and come to the church. The church brings the gospel of salvation to them, and the Lord gains the people He has gained. The church establishes various churches to expand the kingdom of God, and connects many unclear spirits and children who seek truth with friends. God's work grows day by day, and the brothers and sisters also grow day by day in adding.",
