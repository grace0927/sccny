## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/components/sermons/
â”œâ”€â”€ SermonList.tsx          # Main listing component
â”œâ”€â”€ SermonCard.tsx          # Individual sermon preview
â”œâ”€â”€ SermonDetail.tsx        # Full sermon detail page
â”œâ”€â”€ SermonFilters.tsx       # Search and filter controls
â”œâ”€â”€ MediaPlayer.tsx         # Video/audio player
â”œâ”€â”€ SermonPagination.tsx    # Pagination controls
â”œâ”€â”€ LoadingStates.tsx       # Loading skeletons
â””â”€â”€ types.ts               # TypeScript definitions
```

### API Integration Strategy

- **Server Components**: Use Next.js App Router for initial data fetching
- **Client Components**: Handle interactive features (filters, pagination)
- **Data Fetching**: SWR for caching and real-time updates
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Suspense boundaries for better UX

### State Management

- **Local State**: React useState for UI state
- **Server State**: SWR for API data management
- **Global State**: Context API for filter preferences
- **URL State**: Next.js router for shareable URLs

### Styling Approach

- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Flowbite components
- **Consistency**: Follow existing Navigation component patterns
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Dark Mode**: Support for dark/light theme switching
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (High Priority) âœ… COMPLETED

1. âœ… SermonList component with basic API integration
2. âœ… SermonCard component for displaying sermons
3. âœ… SermonDetail page with media players
4. âœ… Basic pagination and sorting
5. âœ… Search functionality in API
6. âœ… Loading states and error handling
7. âœ… Responsive design
8. âœ… Internationalization support
9. âœ… All message types implemented:
   - âœ… Sermon Recordings (`/messages/sermon-recordings`) - Defaults to SERMON type, editable type filter
   - âœ… Sunday School (`/messages/sunday-school`) - Fixed to SUNDAY_SCHOOL type, hidden type filter
   - âœ… Special Gathering (`/messages/special-gathering`) - Fixed to RETREAT_MESSAGE type, hidden type filter
